            <h2>About this project</h2>
            <p> On my second year at DAE me and 5 colleagues were tasked with creating a local multiplayer game. This was the first time I had worked on a game project with people who where not also gamedevelopers.
                We all provided some game ideas and we decided to go with Soup Showdown, a game where players have to collect ingredients to make soup while trying to sabotage the other team.
                Different ingredients have different purposes. For example, some ingredients are worth more points, some ingredients give you a speed boost, and some ingredients let you become huge.
                The goal, to create as much of your best soups before the time runs out.
