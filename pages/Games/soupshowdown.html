            <h2>About this project</h2>
            <p>
                During my second year at DAE, my five colleagues and I were tasked with creating a local multiplayer game. 
                This was the first time I had worked on a game project with people who were not also game developers. 
                We all provided some game ideas, and we decided to go with Soup Showdown, a game where players have to collect ingredients to make soup while trying to sabotage the other team. 
                Different ingredients serve different purposes. For example, some ingredients are worth more points, some give a speed boost, and others let you grow in size. 
                The goal is to create as many of your best soups as possible before time runs out.
